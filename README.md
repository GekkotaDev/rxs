# rxs

A simple reactive state management library with a minimal yet familiar API. The
goals of this library areâ€¦

- Be simple to learn
- Be simple to use
- Be simple to implement

## Prior Works

This library would not have been made without the inspiration or otherwise from
existing libraries/frameworks. Special thanks to

- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) which has been used as a reference on
the implementation of this library, and the biggest inspiration so far.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/signals) for providing the idea of using
classes within this library's implementation of signals, and encouraged the
usage of classes to take advantage of Dart's type system.
- [S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) which has provided extra inspiration
for the implementation of this library.
