## State composition, simplified

Compose states and streams with ease, inspired by Solid.js and the concept
of signals.

The goals this project aims for areâ€¦

- Be simple to learn
- Be simple to use
- Be simple to implement

This project does not aim to be a state management library itself but rather to
complement them, particularly those that primarily use streams. What this
project aims for is to make the composition of state simpler.

## Additional ifnromation

This project started out to extract the hooks from `rxservice` into its own
separate, reusable package independent of services. The extraction eventually
became it's own package.
