# rxs

Another simple reactive state management library for Dart and Flutter
applications. The goals of this library areâ€¦

- Be simple to learn
- Be simple to use
- Be simple to implement

## Prior Works

This library would not have been made without the inspiration from existing
libraries/frameworks.

- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) which has been used as a reference on
the prior implementation of this library, and the biggest inspiration so far.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/signals) with the idea of using classes
for the implementation of this library.
- [Reactively](https://github.com/modderme123/reactively) for the idea of a
hybrid push-pull system.
